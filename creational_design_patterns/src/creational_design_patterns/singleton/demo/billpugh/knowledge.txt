Singleton
--> A class cannot have multiple instances. Ensure a class only has one instance, 
	and provide a global point of access to it. --> restrict unnecessary object creations in 
	a centralized system.

Prior to Java 5, the Java memory model had a lot of issues, and some approaches used 
to fail in certain scenarios where too many threads tried to get the instance of the singleton
class simultaneously. So Bill Pugh came up with a different approach to create the singleton
class using an inner static helper class.
