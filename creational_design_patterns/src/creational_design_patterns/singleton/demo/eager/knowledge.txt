Singleton
--> A class cannot have multiple instances. Ensure a class only has one instance, 
	and provide a global point of access to it. --> restrict unnecessary object creations in 
	a centralized system.
	
In eager initialization, the instance of the singleton class is created at 
the time of class loading. The drawback to eager initialization is that 
the method is created even though the client application might not be using it
